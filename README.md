# nano_chess
A game of nano chess, alias micro chess, or mini chess.

### Introduction
Nano Chess was an idea conceived in conjunction with an excellent coder and long-time friend of mine, Frank Cheung.  We originally created it for iOS and released it in 2012 on the [iTunes app store where it can still be found](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nano-chess/id513295391?mt=8 "Nano Chess on the iTunes App Store").
However, this app hasn't been updated in a long time.

The aim of this excercise is for me to create a version for the web that someone will hopefully enjoy playing and that I can update myself, and more importantly to help me learn the first steps to making games in Ruby.

### Versions
- 0.0.2 Started off the file and spec file but ran into trouble getting rspec-its to work.
- 0.0.1 Corrected typo in the readme, off to a flying start.
- 0.0.0 Is this possible?
